            <h1 class="font-medium text-2xl">Code Platform</h1>
            <p>Code is a platform designed for developers to improve their programming skills, prepare for technical interviews, and solve real-world coding challenges. Here's an overview of how Code works:</p>
            <h2 class="font-medium text-2xl">1. Core Features</h2>
            <p>Problems Library: LeetCode offers a vast collection of problems ranging in difficulty from easy to hard. Problems are categorized by topics such as arrays, strings, dynamic programming, and system design.
                Company Tags: Problems are tagged by companies (like Google, Amazon, Microsoft) to help users practice for specific job interviews.</p>

            <h2 class="font-medium text-2xl">2. How It Works Technically</h2>
            <p>Frontend
                User Interface: Built with modern web technologies like React or Angular to provide an intuitive user experience.
                Code Editor: Uses web-based editors like Monaco (the same as in VS Code) with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging features.
                Backend
                Code Execution Engine:
                LeetCode sends the user's code to secure servers for compilation and execution.
                The engine evaluates the solution against predefined test cases (both visible and hidden).
                Results (pass/fail, runtime, memory usage) are sent back to the user.
                Sandboxing: User code is executed in an isolated environment to prevent malicious actions or interference with the server.</p>
            <h2 class="font-medium text-2xl">3. Features for Users</h2>
            <p>Practice Modes
                Timed Mode: Mimics real interview scenarios with time constraints.
                Topic-Wise Practice: Allows focusing on specific concepts.
                Community
                Discussion Forums: Users can discuss solutions, interview experiences, and more.
                Solution Sharing: View others' solutions after solving a problem or unlocking the solution.
                Premium Features
                Access to company-specific problem sets.
                Video solutions and more detailed problem explanations.</p>
            <h2 class="font-medium text-2xl">4. Real-Time Processing</h2>
            <p>Performance Metrics: Shows runtime and memory usage compared to other submissions.
                Optimized Infrastructure: Uses scalable cloud services to handle high traffic and simultaneous code submissions.</p>
